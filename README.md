# UWP-Flow-Frame
Flow Frame is a new and improved Frame control. This builds upon the default frame control by providing high-performance page transition animations powered by the composition layer. Fresh, new animations will be used by default, with options to configure the animations or even created your own custom animations (from scratch).
